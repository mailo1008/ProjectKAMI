    <p>Once upon a time... On a bright and sunny day a child took a walk into the desert. 
        The orphan was taking a picnic to their uncle. On a cold and frosty dawn a girl took a 
        ramble into the wood. The sun was shining and the boy was ready for anything. The child 
        was taking a pie to their grandad. On a dark and stormy night a orphan took a walk into 
        the desert. The boy was taking a chocolate cookie to their aunt. The the rain was stopping 
        and the girl was ready for anything. On a cold and frosty day a child took a run into 
        the forest.</p>
        
    <p>Whatever would happen to grandma now that the robber had taken them? We need a princess 
        to come to the rescue... Whatever would happen to uncle now that the ghost had taken them? 
        We need a shepherd to come to the rescue... When they got to the house, the wolf had the 
        grandma tied up. Each was completely unaware but a giant was hiding behind a tree. When 
        they got to the castle, the ghost had the aunt tied up. We need a badass girl to come to 
        the rescue... Whatever would happen to grandma now that the robber had taken them? As they 
        walked though the wood the boy felt like someone was watching them. When they got to the dungeon, 
        the ghost had the uncle tied up.</p>
        
    <p>The girl, the knight and the grandad lived happily ever after. The woodsman saved the day by capturing
        the giant. The boy, the shepherd and the uncle lived happily ever after. The badass girl saved 
        the day by stabbing the ghost. The child, the woodsman and the aunt lived happily ever after. 
        The princess saved the day by beheading the giant. Next time the orphan went for a ramble in 
        the forest they would call the woodsman first! The small child saved the day by capturing the ghost.</p>
